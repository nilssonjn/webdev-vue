# Lab 2: HTML, CSS, and Vue â€“ User Program (e.g., "Tasks", "Workout Schedule", "Leisure Activities", "Weekly Menu")

## Objectives and Purpose
In Lab 2, you will create a basic project using the Vue.js framework with HTML and CSS. By the end of the course, students should be able to build modern web applications, where the use of a JavaScript framework is a key part. This lab serves as an introduction to working with Vue.js in combination with HTML and CSS.

## Assignment
You will build a web application using HTML, CSS, and Vue. The app will manage tasks for a user, such as a task list, workout schedule, leisure activities, or weekly menu. Choose a theme and build the program around it.

The purpose of this lab is to introduce the fundamental aspects of using a framework like Vue.js in combination with HTML and CSS. 

### Requirements
- The program should include a list that the user can add to and remove from, based on the chosen theme.
- Some parts of the program do not need to be related to the list and can be stored in variables (e.g., user name, settings).

### Submission Requirements
- **Source Code:** Submit the complete source code of the website.
- **Theme:** Choose a theme for the program and adapt both functionality and design accordingly.
- **Technologies:** The web application must be built using HTML, CSS, and the Vue framework.
- **Code Quality:** Ensure the HTML and CSS are well-structured and error-free.

### Program Requirements
- The program must include a list (based on your theme) that is stored in an object. Users should be able to add and remove items from the list.
- The program should also allow users to input data (e.g., name, settings), which can be linked to the usage of the program.
- The following Vue.js features must be implemented (even if you write some of the code in JavaScript):
  - **Component:** Implement a Vue component for one part of the program.
  - **Form Input and Events:** Use event handling such as `v-on:click` for form inputs. You can also use `v-model` for interactive user input.
  - **Data Binding:** Declare relevant variables in the `data()` block. (Alternatively, in the component block for data depending on your code structure.)
  - **List Management:** Store the list in an object declared in the `data()` block. (Alternatively, in the component block for data depending on your code structure.)
  - **Methods:** Write methods in the `methods()` block. (Alternatively, in the component block depending on your code structure.)

### Design and Responsiveness
- The website must be responsive for both desktop and mobile. Design an interface that works well for desktop (and tablet) with more spacing and a more compact version for mobile.
- Use Grid and/or Flexbox as well as Media Queries where necessary.

### Additional Features
- Implement a custom feature using Vue.js Directives (e.g., `v-if`) and Style Binding. The appearance of the program should change based on user actions, adding meaningful functionality. Examples include changing the priority of list items or altering colors and formatting based on a relevant user action.
